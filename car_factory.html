					<h2>Car Factory</h2>
					<p>In order to make a vehicle you must collect the correct car parts, know as “resources” . All resources are represented by resource cards (such as the one pictured below).
 
Resources can be obtained either from the Resource Broker desk or by trading with other companies.

<p>The resource cards are split into three main categories:</p>

<p>•    Raw:         Four simple resources; ‘Oil’, ‘Sand’, ‘Rubber’ and ‘Ore’.</p>
<p>•    Refined:         Improved materials; ‘Glass’, ‘Metal’ and ‘Plastic’.</p>
<p>•    Manufactured:  Components parts of a car such as windscreen and engine.</p> 

<p>‘<b>Raw</b>’ resources are used to make ‘<b>Refined</b>’ resources.</p> 
<p>‘<b>Refined</b>’ resources are used to make ‘<b>Manufactured</b>’ resources.</p>
<p>‘<b>Manufactured</b>’ resources are used to make a <b>VEHICLE</b> and have limited availability.</p>

<p>You and TWO OTHER COMPANIES can make the Manufactured resource shown on your desk.  Think wisely, and make enough to sell/trade with other companies who WILL NEED YOUR PART.</p>
					</p>
					<h3>Building a VEHICLE</h3>
					<p>
Every company makes a car.<br>

To make a ‘Car’ you must collect all of the required resource cards, which are:<br>
<table border="0, white">
<tr>
<td>4 x Wheel</td>
<td>1 x Engine</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4 x Bodywork</td>
<td>1 x Plastic</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2 x Windscreen    </td>
<td>1 x Rubber</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1 x Electronics   </td>
<td>1 x Oil</td>
</tr>
</table>
			
					</p>
					<h3>Selling a VEHICLE</h3>
					<p>
					To sell a vehicle you take your car card to the Car Dealership desk.  They will then buy the ‘Car’ from you for the rate, determined earlier when you gave your team presentation to The Dragons Den.
					</p>
					<p><font color="red">
					You MUST sell at least one VEHICLE during the day to be able to win.
					</font></p>
					<h3>Factories</h3>
					<p> Every Refined resource card has as a matching factory card. Each factory card allows you to make that resource card for half its resource cost.</p>
