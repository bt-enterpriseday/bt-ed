          <p>BT or British Telecom is currently a large scale multinational company; within BT martlesham it is hosting around 4000 employees and multinationally hosting around 110,000 employees (2017 count). As said, BT is a large scale company which was first created / founded in 1969 or 48 years ago where it started production and research in telecommunication services, introducing phone services and network connections. For example; internet broadbrand otherwise known as BT Broadbrand. Whilst making and investing money into developement and research of the very technology needed to make BT's networks, and to increase performance such as band width, and packet loss.

          <h4>Work Experience:</h4>
          <p>
BT being a big and famous company and having a lot of departments, it may come as no surprise that the work experience offered here is quite widely ranged and a big variety of jobs can be offered; meaning not much experience is need to see what it's like to work for BT. Obviously some requirements to work for BT are quite high, so you can't just get straight into doing exactaly what the employees do. However more importantly it's a really good opportunity to develop an understanding of how things are done inside the company, whilst learning programming languages, and how bt's networks and physical hardware works.
          </p>
          <p>So in conclusion BT Work experience is a really good chance to develop an understanding for the tasks and jobs they do and actually learn some of it for instance; A "Software Trainee"; where you learn "HTML", "CSS", "Ruby", "Ruby on Rails" and then apply the knowledge you've accumulated by making a small website project. It is also worth noting that they do a program / course for 16-24 year olds to gain "Knowledge and new skills" and in general offer different placement roles of work for year 10 (around 15 or 16 year olds). On the placement you work with usual uk office working hours; 9:00-17:00 which is 8 hours.

          <h3>What We Did</h3>
          <p>For our work experience we did the job of a Software Trainee, where we've learnt some high level programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, the general use of terminals including Git-Hub and the basic functions of these programming languages and how they interact with each other.</p> 
          <p>Obviously in BT you cannot just start out straight away in Year 10-13 doing exacly what some of our hosts are doing, so personally I like to think of it as more of a learning experience which gives a reasonably good rough idea of what jobs such as programming for long hours would be like and the important interactions and links between different departments of BT, which give you good experience and some great useful skills for web development, with the final choice of whether you would like to continue with BT or not.</p>
