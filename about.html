					<p style="clear: left">The BT Business Enterprise Day event is run by BT volunteers and is held in our main Exhibition Hall at Adastral Park (Martlesham Heath).  Aimed at around 250 Year 9 or Year 10 students of mixed ability, you are grouped up into around 25 individual businesses who compete to be the day’s most successful company.</p>

					<p>Winning the event is quite simple, you simply have to meet these milestones:</p>
					
					<ul>
					<li>End the day with the most cash in the bank, and owning a large percentage of your company!</li>
					<li>Build and sell virtual cars; achieved through the accumulation of car-part tokens that can only be completed by trading/negotiating with other teams.</li>
					<li>Raise initial capital (for your car parts) with a start-up loan.</li>
					<li>Raise initial and ongoing capital by trading in shares using our online share-trading software.</li>
					<li>Maintain your company bank account using our online banking software.</li>
					<li>Raise additional capital by "investing in" (paying for) and completing physical team activities and a variety of reasonably complex quizzes and questionnaires, which all provide a "return on investment".</li>
					<li>Complete a mock-government paperwork exercise.</li>
					<li>Have two people pitch a short two minute Dragon’s Den style presentation on "why their company is investable".</li>
					<li>Negotiate with "The Union" when your "car factory workers" go on strike, trying to reach a low-cost outcome.</li>
					<li>Generally manage your company/team (lead by a Chief Executive Officer and a Chief Financial Officer) and handle/negotiate with all other competing.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>Ultimately to win, you’ll need to be organised and effectively build a “virtual factory” that produces many cars at a great price.</p>
