					<h2>The Shop</h2>
					<p>The Shop is your local base where all manner of things take place.  The main thing you can do at The Shop is to invest your money in quizzes and physical activities.  Success in these will bring you a return on your investment that you can then spend on the resources you need to build your vehicles.
 
Like a real shop, you can also learn useful things about the world around you (i.e. Enterprise Day), sometimes get discounted goods (at auctions), use their computing facilities and recently it’s become a local contact point for business-regulators in the community who can help with any “legal” issues.
					</p>
          <h3> Quizzes</h3>
          <p>
There are different levels of quiz.  Cheap and easy ones, with limited return.  Pricey and tricky ones, with a high return.  Typically you’ll get some money back even if you only get a handful of questions correct.    If you need help answering questions, you can always purchase time at The Shop’s <b>Internet Café</b>.
					</p>
					<p>
<i>TIP:</i> Always have a quiz on the go in your office/table area.  This is a great way to keep people busy and to keep money flowing in.		</p>
                                        
					<h3>Activities</h3>
					<p>
Like quizzes, the physical activities also get you a return on your investment.  Activities always require a team, but be careful not to let your CEO get too involved - leaders should be leading and not doing!!!
					</p>
					<h3>The Quiz/Activity Punch Card </h3>
					<p>
In your folder you’ll find a card with all the quizzes and activities listed on it.  As you complete each quiz and activity make sure you get the relevant section hole punched.  That way you’ll have a very visual reminder of the money making tasks that you still have left to do.
					</p>
					<h3>Regulators</h3>
					<p>
Business is a frantic game, and sometimes things happen that the players feel isn’t always fair or right.  This is where the regulators can help. In the past, regulators had to be approached via a complex process, but now they have an office based at your local shop making them easily accessible.  If you have an issue with another company that you can’t negotiate though, try the Regulators.
