					<h2>The Bank</h2>
					<p>The Bank is an important part of the business simulation day. The bank has a set of rules that they must adhere to:</p>
					<div id="p1">
						<h3>Bank Rules</h3>
					</div>
					<p>
					1. Opening an account is done by choosing your loan amount - you tell US how much you need but don't be a greedy pig!  Do this at the Loan Office.<br />
					2. Workers work to bring home the bacon so you must pay wages. This figure starts at £225 and is payable hourly. <br>
					3. Wages increase and decrease depend on your success or failure. You may (or may not) be able to negotiate. <br>
					4. Wage increases may also depend on inflation and employee satisfaction. Keep your snout on your costs! <br>
					5. Interest is charged or added at the end of every hour. Clear debts late and you may be fried. <br>
					6. The bank will close for lunch. Bacon sandwiches... 'mmmm' <br>
					7. The bank manager will only deal with high ranking company officers for important deals. Life's a pig. <br>
					8. Transactions will only be done with official company badge wearers. Not little piglets. <br>
					9. Bank managers are almost always fair and can't be corrupted. <br>
					 10. Bank reserves the right to alter, defer, create, forget, enforce and enhance rules as it sees fit. <br>
					 The bank should be used wisely.  It will earn you some interest, but largely it’s there for you to pay cheques into and withdraw cash.  Remember that it’s great having a large bank balance, but that money won’t be working for you – far better to withdraw the cash and use it to help kick start the manufacturing of your cars. <br>
					</p>
					<h3>
Bank account pins</h3>
					<p>
In your pack, you’ll find a PIN for your bank account. You will be asked to enter it into a keypad when you deal with your branch of the bank.  Don’t SHARE with other companies or LOSE the token, otherwise others will be able to steal your money! <br />
          </p>
<h3>Loan office</h3>
<p> 
The Loan Office is a department of the Bank that is responsible for the administration of business startup loans, including processing loan applications and handling loan repayments and debt issues.<br />
Complete the end of day financial audit (all companies get audited).<br />
There are a number of different loan types that can be purchased. <br />
All loans should be applied for, within the first 30 minutes of the trading day, by your Chief Finance Officer (CFO).  ONLY the CFO (and up to one assistant) will be dealt with by the loan office. Anyone else attempting to apply for a loan will be turned away.<br />
		Your CFO must present your “company start up form” with all the roles completed and a suitable business plan filled in.<br />
		Typical amounts range from £$500 up to £$2000 – remember to bear in mind how much money you think you can make from quizzes, etc so that you can be sure you can meet the repayments.<br />
		There are three types of loan, the classic loan (with regular payments), a buy-now-pay-later style loan (no initial payments, pay later at a fixed time) and a low initial interest rate loan (low initial payments when money is tight, then higher compensating payments when you have more money).  <br />
		ou’ll find in this pack a description of each of these loan types plus an illustration of how much a typical loan would cost.<br />
