              <h3>Maxim Kuzin</h3>
              <h4>Personal BT Experience:</h4><p> Over my course at BT I learned how to use HTML, CSS and other various languages with the rest of the group. Having the knowledge and understanding of the coding languages I was able to start working on a replica of a functioning google search page and develop it throughout the first week as we learned more things. Creating my own website and experimenting with code has broadened my understanding of coding in general and how things are done in modern world. Being here for the second week and having the task of making the website about BT gave me an opportunity to apply the knowledge of web-development languages that I have accumulated.</p>
              <h4>Favourite part of BT Work Experience:</h4><p> The best and most fun part of the work experience was definetely the BT website creation as it made me go to the edge of my HTML and CSS knowledge, which tested my skills and also helped me learn new commands and ways to code a website.</p>
            </li>

              <h3>Oliver Evenden</h3>
              <h4>Personal BT Experiences:</h4><p> I've learnt how to use HTML to create a webistes on Dogs and Rabbits. This knowledge has also helped me create a couple websites about dogs and rabbits and an immitation of Bing's homepage, which funtioned correctly. I also learned the basics of the programming language Ruby.</p>
              <h4>Favourite part of BT Work Experience:</h4><p> I quite liked creating my own website using html and css because it was something I was good at and something that was easy to understand - I used a selection of different tutorials to help me make my website function properly.</p>
            </li>

              <h3>Tom Jacobs</h3>
              <h4>Personal BT Experiences:</h4><p> Throughout the two weeks working at BT I have began to understand and use programming languages such as the following; HTML, Ruby on Rails and along with the main programming language's I've also learnt and applied the use of CSS and Bootstrap, which help to structure and style a website, which within my first week I applied through making small test websites and through parts of the first week I've also covered the basics of using a terminal.</p>
              <h4>Favourite part of BT Work Experience:</h4><p> My favourite part of the two weeks that I've spent here was using html to experiment with different website features and commands.</p>
            </li>

              <h3>Penny Garwood</h3>
              <h4>Personal BT Experiences:</h4><p> I've learnt the basics of the high programming language Ruby, which is very similar to python - and then I applied this to understand the very simple basics of Ruby On Rails and improved my understading and utilisation of HTML. This has also enabled me to incorporate the use of Boostrap, which made my mini projects look more professional.</p>
              <h4>Favourite part of BT Work Experience:</h4><p> I really enjoyed using HTML to create my own websites aswell as trying out new ideas,
based on the knowledge I was accumulating at the same time.</p>

          <h3>Work Experience</h3>
          <p>BT offers work experience for a wide range of ages starting from year 10. This opportunity provides excellent experience to those who are exploring the working world, those who are considering BT's apprenticeship scheme or maybe the people who would just like to see what BT's working enviroment is like.</p>
          <p>One can apply for a specific department of BT to work in and will then be put in a group with other individuals which will be assigned a host who will introduce them and guide them through their work experience. The host is a long-term BT employee who specialises in the particular field. You will also be taken on tours around the adastral park and will be shown presentations to learn more about what BT does.</p>
